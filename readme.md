There are many tools to help us build neural networks today, but for students and researchers, it is still necessary to understand the specific implementation of neural networks. This repository is used to show how to use Python and Numpy to achieve a not-so-bad performance deep BP neural network. I mean, the usage of this repository is not a tool, but a learning material.
